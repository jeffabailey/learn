# LLM Instructions for Educational Learning Repository

This repository contains educational learning materials designed for beginners. All AI assistants (Claude, GPT, etc.) MUST follow these strict guidelines to maintain the educational quality and accessibility of this project.

## 🎓 Core Principle: Beginner-First Approach

**CRITICAL**: This is an educational project. Every line of code, every comment, and every test must be understandable by someone learning programming for the first time.

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Write Code for Beginners**
   - Use clear, descriptive variable names (avoid abbreviations like `tmp`, `ctx`, `cfg`)
   - Prefer explicit over clever code
   - Add explanatory comments for ANY concept beyond basic syntax
   - Break complex operations into smaller, named steps
   - Avoid advanced language features unless teaching them explicitly
   - Use simple, linear logic flow when possible

2. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Every function/method MUST have a docstring explaining:
     - What it does (in simple terms)
     - What parameters it takes (with types and examples)
     - What it returns
     - Example usage
   - Every file MUST have a module docstring explaining its purpose
   - README.md required in each learning folder with:
     - Clear description of what is being taught
     - Prerequisites (if any)
     - How to run the code (step-by-step)
     - Link to associated blog post
     - Expected output/results

3. **Example Documentation Style**
   ```python
   def calculate_average(numbers):
       """
       Calculate the average (mean) of a list of numbers.

       The average is found by adding all numbers together and dividing
       by how many numbers there are.

       Parameters:
           numbers (list): A list of numbers (integers or floats)
                         Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

       Returns:
           float: The average of all numbers
                 Example: 3.0 for input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

       Example:
           >>> calculate_average([10, 20, 30])
           20.0
       """
       total = sum(numbers)  # Add all numbers together
       count = len(numbers)  # Count how many numbers we have
       return total / count   # Divide total by count
   ```

## ✅ Test Coverage Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Aim for 100% test coverage on all code within reason.

### Testing Standards

1. **Coverage Targets**
   - Strive for 100% code coverage
   - Minimum acceptable: 95% coverage for educational modules
   - Every function MUST have at least one test
   - Every edge case should be tested
   - Every error condition should be tested

2. **Test Quality**
   - Tests MUST be readable and serve as examples
   - Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
   - Format: `test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected_result>`
   - Example: `test_calculate_average_with_positive_numbers_returns_correct_mean`
   - Include comments in tests explaining the "why"
   - Tests should be as simple and clear as the code they test

3. **Test File Organization**
   - Place tests in the same directory as the code they test
   - Name test files: `test_<module_name>.py`
   - For comprehensive learning content: `test_all.py` that runs all tests
   - Each test file should be runnable independently

4. **Test Documentation**
   - Each test file MUST have a docstring explaining what is tested
   - Include examples of running tests in README.md
   - Document any test dependencies or setup requirements

## 🚀 Execution Simplicity

**CRITICAL**: Code must be trivial to run. Assume the user has minimal technical knowledge.

### Setup Requirements

1. **Minimize Dependencies**
   - Use standard library when possible
   - Keep external dependencies to minimum
   - Document ALL dependencies clearly
   - Provide lock files (requirements.txt, package-lock.json, etc.)

2. **Clear Run Instructions**
   - README.md MUST include step-by-step run instructions
   - Assume no prior knowledge of the tools
   - Include expected output examples
   - Document both development and testing commands

3. **Example README Run Section**
   ```markdown
   ## How to Run This Code

   ### Prerequisites
   - Python 3.10 or higher installed
   - pip (Python package installer)

   ### Setup (First Time Only)
   1. Open a terminal/command prompt
   2. Navigate to this folder: `cd programming/python`
   3. Install dependencies: `pip install -e ".[test]"`

   ### Running the Code
   ```bash
   # Run the main program
   python main.py

   # Run all tests
   pytest

   # Run tests with coverage report
   pytest --cov --cov-report=term
   ```

   ### Expected Output
   When you run the tests, you should see:
   ```
   ========== 15 passed in 0.23s ==========
   Coverage: 100%
   ```
   ```

## 🔒 Self-Contained Learning Modules

**CRITICAL**: Each learning folder must be completely self-contained and single-language.

### Module Organization Rules

1. **Language Isolation**
   - NEVER mix programming languages in the same learning module
   - Each folder should teach ONE language or framework
   - If a concept needs multiple languages, create separate folders
   - Example structure:
     ```
     programming/
       python/          # Python only
       javascript/      # JavaScript only
       go/              # Go only
     ```

2. **Self-Contained Modules**
   - Users must be able to clone ONLY one folder and have it work
   - No dependencies on parent directories (except for CI configuration)
   - Each module has its own:
     - Dependencies file (pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.)
     - README.md with complete instructions
     - Test suite
     - All necessary code and resources
   - Example: Someone should be able to run:
     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/jeffabailey/learn
     cd learn
     git sparse-checkout set programming/python
     cd programming/python
     pip install -e ".[test]"
     pytest
     # Everything works!
     ```

3. **Resource Management**
   - If data files are needed, include them in the module
   - Keep sample data small (< 1MB when possible)
   - Document any external resources clearly
   - Provide mock data for testing

## 🔄 CI/CD Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Each learning folder MUST have automated testing via GitHub Actions.

### GitHub Actions Standards

1. **Workflow Configuration**
   - Add test job to `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` for each new module
   - Each module must have its own job in the workflow
   - Jobs must run tests and generate coverage reports
   - Jobs should be named clearly: `<module-name>-tests`

2. **Required CI Checks**
   - ✅ Run all tests
   - ✅ Generate coverage report
   - ✅ Upload coverage to Codecov
   - ✅ Run linting/style checks (when applicable)
   - ✅ Check code formatting (when applicable)

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Tests must pass before merging
   - Coverage should not decrease
   - No linting errors allowed
   - All dependencies must be properly declared

4. **Example Workflow Job Template**
   ```yaml
   new-module-tests:
     name: New Module Name
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     defaults:
       run:
         working-directory: path/to/module

     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v4

       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v5
         with:
           python-version: '3.13'
           cache: 'pip'

       - name: Install dependencies
         run: |
           python -m pip install --upgrade pip
           pip install -e ".[test]"

       - name: Run tests with coverage
         run: |
           pytest --cov --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term

       - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
         uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
         with:
           file: ./path/to/module/coverage.xml
           flags: new-module
           name: new-module-coverage
         env:
           CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
   ```

## 🚫 Prohibited Practices

**NEVER** do these things in this repository:

1. ❌ Write code that requires deep technical knowledge to understand
2. ❌ Skip tests or reduce coverage "to save time"
3. ❌ Mix programming languages in a single learning module
4. ❌ Create dependencies between learning modules
5. ❌ Use advanced features without extensive explanation
6. ❌ Assume prior knowledge beyond the stated prerequisites
7. ❌ Skip documentation because "the code is self-explanatory"
8. ❌ Add dependencies without clear justification
9. ❌ Create code that can't be run with simple commands
10. ❌ Skip CI/CD setup for new modules

## 💡 Best Practices for AI Assistants

When working on this repository:

1. **Always Ask About Complexity**
   - If you're about to write something complex, stop
   - Ask: "Can a beginner understand this?"
   - If no, simplify or break it down further

2. **Test-First Mindset**
   - Write tests as you write code
   - Think: "How would a beginner verify this works?"
   - Use tests as teaching examples

3. **Documentation is Code**
   - Treat documentation with same importance as code
   - Poor documentation is a bug
   - When in doubt, over-explain

4. **Consistency Matters**
   - Follow patterns from existing modules
   - Keep coding style consistent within each language
   - Match the level of detail in existing documentation

5. **Simplicity Over Cleverness**
   - Readable > Concise
   - Obvious > Elegant
   - Educational > Performant
   - Remember: This code teaches, it doesn't need to be production-ready

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A learning module is successful when:

1. A complete beginner can understand the code by reading it
2. Someone can clone just that folder and run it immediately
3. Tests demonstrate how the code works and show expected behavior
4. Coverage is near 100% and gives confidence in correctness
5. CI/CD catches any regressions automatically
6. The code serves as a reference implementation for the concept
7. Documentation answers questions before they're asked
